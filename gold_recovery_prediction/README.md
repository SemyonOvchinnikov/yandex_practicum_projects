# Predicting gold recovery from ore

## Description
It is required to develop a model predicting the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. Data with mining and refining parameters are used as input data. The model will help to optimize production to avoid running a plant with unprofitable characteristics

## Plan
1. EDA
2. Data preprocessing
3. Metric selection and model fit
4. Model testing

## Teck Stack
*pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn*
