|:---------------|:---------------|:-----|:----|
|Steel temperature prediction during desulfurization|In order to optimize production costs, the steel plant decided to reduce electricity consumption at the steel processing stage. It is required to build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel. The model will be used to simulate various process scenarios. End users - customer's production technologists|pandas, numpy, sklearn, catboost, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn|[ссылка](https://github.com/SemyonOvchinnikov/yandex_practicum_projects/tree/main/desulfurization_steel_temperature_prediction)|
|Прогнозирование восстановление золота из руды|It is required to develop a model predicting the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. Data with mining and refining parameters are used as input data. The model will help to optimize production to avoid running a plant with unprofitable characteristics|pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn|[ссылка](https://github.com/SemyonOvchinnikov/yandex_practicum_projects/tree/main/gold_recovery_prediction)|
|Customer churn rate|It is required to predict whether a client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on customer behavior and termination of contracts with the bank are provided. It is required to build a model with the target value of F1 metric 0.59|pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib|[ссылка](https://github.com/SemyonOvchinnikov/yandex_practicum_projects/tree/main/churn_rate_prediction)|
|Video game sales analysisр|Online store sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert evaluations, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. It is required to identify the patterns that determine the success of a game. This will allow to focus on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns. Provided data through 2016, and planning a campaign for 2017.|pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, re, datetime|[ссылка](https://github.com/SemyonOvchinnikov/yandex_practicum_projects/tree/main/videogames_sales_analysis)|
